# SpringPractice
This is repository for saving test spring projects which I code based on [Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/learn/lecture/8974710#overview)

The content of couses is:

- Spring 5 Core
- AOP
- Spring MVC
- Spring Security
- Spring Rest
- Spring Boot 2
- Thymeleaf
- JPA
- Hibernate

**I have noted for courses on Xmind, which is useful**
